# Music and Madness Bot Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 17, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how CaptainCurso ("we," "us," "our") processes information when operating the Music and Madness Discord bot and related sync tooling (the "Bot").

## 1. Information We Process

Depending on your configuration, we may process:

- Discord server (guild), channel, message, and user IDs
- usernames and display names
- message content and timestamps
- attachment metadata only (filename, URL, content type, size)
- sync/runtime metadata (for example, cursors, dedupe indexes, run summaries)
- local archive references and paths
- Notion page IDs and sync metadata where Notion integration is enabled

## 2. Why We Process Information

We process this information to:

- import and archive selected Discord channel history
- normalize names to configured character labels
- generate campaign summaries/transcripts
- sync selected outputs into Notion
- prevent duplicate imports and monitor sync reliability

## 3. Storage and Retention

Data may be stored in local files and local state databases controlled by the operator, and optionally in Notion.

Retention is controlled by server/operator decisions. We aim to keep data only as long as needed for the documented campaign workflow, legal obligations, and operational troubleshooting.

## 4. Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell personal information.

We may share data only with processors required to provide the workflow (for example Discord API and Notion API), or when required by law.

## 5. Security

We use reasonable technical and operational safeguards. No method of storage or transmission is guaranteed to be perfectly secure.

## 6. Your Choices and Requests

Server administrators control installation, channel scope, and ongoing bot access.

To request deletion, correction, or access information for data controlled by this Bot workflow, contact:

- captaincursor@gmail.com

## 7. International Processing

Data may be processed in jurisdictions other than your own, subject to applicable legal requirements.

## 8. Children

The Bot is not directed to children below the age required by applicable law and Discord policy.

## 9. Policy Updates

We may update this Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date reflects the latest revision.
